## Summary

I build full-stack systems that push technical boundaries, specializing in React.js and Next.js applications from real-time trading platforms to AI-powered testing frameworks. With over a decade of React experience, I create scalable frontend architectures and have recently integrated cutting-edge AI and machine learning capabilities into web applications. My coding experience predates the AI boom, allowing me to code and debug effectively with or without AI assistance‚Äîmy preferred model being Claude Code. I combine deep React/Next.js expertise with practical problem-solving learned from years of challenging projects across fintech, aerospace, and enterprise automation.
